<h3>Discretization of a continuous-time signal (sampling and aliasing)</h3>

<p>
Consider a continous-time signal \(x_c(t)\) whose Fourier transform is \(X_c(\Omega)\). Then
$$ x_c(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} X_c(\Omega) e^{j \Omega t} d\Omega  \qquad(1)$$
and
$$ X_c(\Omega)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} x_c(t) e^{-j \Omega t} dt \qquad(2)$$

A discrete-time signal \(x_d(n)\) can be obtained by uniformly sampling the continuous-time 
signal \(x_c(t)\) at discrete intervals \(nT\) where T is called the sampling period and n is an integer. Consider 
a unit impulse function \(\delta(t)\), whose value is \(1\) at \(t=0\) and \(0\) elsewhere. 
Then the unit impulse sequence can be expressed as 
$$ s(t) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-nT), \qquad(3) $$
and \(x_d(n)\) can be expressed as 

\begin{eqnarray}
x_d(n) & = & x_c(t) s(t) \qquad(4)  \\
		 & = & x_c(t) \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-nT) \qquad(5)\\
		 & = & \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x_c(nT) \delta(t-nT). \qquad(6)
\end{eqnarray} </p>

</table>
<br>
<p>
Figure 1 illustrates the process and effect of sampling a continuous-time signal in the time domain.
In the frequency domain, the corresponding Fourier transform of \(x_d(n)\) can be obtained by 
convolving the individual Fourier transforms of \(x_c(t)\) and \(s(t)\). This is because multiplication
of two sequences in the time domain is equivalent to convolution in the Fourier domain. Similarly 
multiplication in the Fourier domain is equivalent of convolution in the time domain.
</p>
<p>

<p>To observe the effect of sampling in the frequency domain, we need to consider the Fourier Transform of \(s(t)\).
Since \(s(t)\) is periodic with period T, using Fourier series expansion it can be shown that
$$
s(t) = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-j k \Omega_s t}, \qquad(7)
$$
where \(\Omega_s=\frac{2\pi}{T}\) is the sampling frequency.
</p>

<p>Now the Fourier transform of \(s(t)\) may be computed as 
\begin{eqnarray}
S(\Omega) & = & \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t) e^{-j \Omega t} dt  \qquad(8)\\
	& = & \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-j k \Omega_s t} e^{-j \Omega t} dt \qquad(9)\\
	& = & \frac{2\pi}{T}  \sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(\Omega - k \Omega_s). \qquad(10)
\end{eqnarray} 
</p>
<p>
Thus the Fourier transform of an impulse train with period \(T\) is another impulse train with period \(\Omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T}\).
To illustrate the effect of sampling in the frequency domain, consider some arbitrary Fouirer 
transform of a signal with bandwidth \(B\) shown in Figure&nbsp;2(a). The Fourier transform of the impulse train sequence
with period \(T\) is shown in Figure&nbsp;2(b) where \(F_s=\frac{1}{T}\) denotes the sampling frequency. The corresponding discrete-time
Fourier transform of the sampled signal is shown in Figure 2(c) for the case where \(F_s \gt 2B\). If the sampling frequency is reduced (\(F_s \lt 2B \)),
the resultant discrete-time Fourier transform (shown in Figure&nbsp;2(d)) clearly indicates the overlapping of spectral components.
This effect is called aliasing and is due to an insufficient sampling rate. If the signal is sampled at a sampling frequency of 
 \(F_s = 2B\), then no spectral distortion occurs as can be seen from (shown in Figure&nbsp;3). Hence the minimum sampling frequency 
 required to discretize a signal without aliasing is equivalent to twice the bandwidth of the signal. This frequency
 is referred to as the Nyquist rate.

<h3>Digitization of a discrete-time signal - Quantization and quantization error</h3>
<p>
A discrete-time signal obtained through sampling is still a continuous amplitude time sequence, where each sample 
value has an infinite precision. But digital computers are finite precision machines and hence there is a need to discretize 
and limit the range of sample values. This is achieved by quantization (more accurately scalar quantization). In the
quantization process, each sampled value of a discrete-time signal is compared against a finite set of amplitude values 
and assigned a value in the set that is closest to the discrete-time value. The number of elements in the
finite set is determined by the precision of the digital system. In an 8-bit system, there are \(2^8 =256\) elements in the set. 
The number of elements in the the finite 
set is referred as the number of quantization levels. If the difference in values of adjacent elements in the ordered
set is constant, then the quantizer is referred as an uniform linear quantizer. Figure&nbsp;4 shows the effect of 
quantizing a line using a 3-bit quantizer.

<caption align="bottom">
<b>Figure 4:</b><em> Quantization of a linear segment of an analog signal.</em> 
</caption>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Since the digital signal is obtained by quantizing the continuous valued discrete-time signal, there is an error introduced in
representation of the signal. If the discrete-time signal \(x_d(n)\) has a limited amplitude range 
i.e., \(|x_d(n)|\leq A_\mbox{max}\), the quantization step for a B-bit uniform quantizer is given by
$$
Q_s = \frac{2A_{max}}{2^B} \qquad(11)
$$
The maximum quantization error introduced by a B-bit uniform quantizer is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
Q_{e_{max}} & = & \frac{Q_s}{2}  \qquad(12)\\
Q_{e_{max}} & = & \frac{A_\mbox{max}}{2^B} \qquad(13)
\end{eqnarray}
Hence the quantization error for each sample \(e(n)\)  is defined as 
$$
e(n) = x_d(n)-x_D(n), \qquad(14)
$$
where \(x_d(n)\) is the discrete-time infinite precision sampled value of the continuous-time signal \(x(t)\), and \(x_D(n)\) is the finite precision digitized (sampled and quantized) sample value.
The quantization error at each sample lies within the range
$$
-Q_{e_{max}} \leq e(n) \leq Q_{e_{max}}. \qquad (15)
$$
</p>

<h3> Design of resonator</h3>
<p>
A resonator is an all-pole system. The transfer function of an all-pole system \(H(z)\) is given by 
$$ H(z) = \frac{1}{1+\sum^{N}_{k=1}{{a_k z^{-k}}}}, \qquad (16) $$
where <font size=-1>\(\{a_k\}\)</font>s denote the real coefficients of the denominator polynomial of order <font size=-1>\(N\)</font>.
Roots of the denominator polynomial in <font size=-1>\(z^{-1}\)</font> give real or complex poles.
Real roots correspond to zero frequency or <font size=-1>\(F_s/2\)</font>.
Complex roots of a polynomial with real coefficients always occur in complex conjugate pairs corresponding to a frequency related to the angle of the complex root.
Each pair of complex conjugate roots (or poles) corresponds to a second order polynomial which may be denoted as
$$ H(z) = \frac{1}{(1-z_iz^{-1})(1-z_i^*z^{-1})} = \frac{1}{1+a_{i_1}z^{-1}+a_{i_2}z^{-2}}, \qquad (17)$$

where the complex root <font size=-1>\(z_i\)</font> is given by

$$ z_i=r_i e^{j2\pi\frac{F_i}{F_s}}, \qquad (18)	$$
	where <font size=-1>\(F_i\)</font> denotes the resonance frequency of the second order system, and <font size=-1>\(r_i\)</font> corresponds to the resonance bandwidth <font size=-1>\(B_i\)</font> given by
	$$	r_i=e^{-\pi B_i T}, \qquad (19)	$$
	where <font size=-1>\(T\)</font> denotes the sampling interval.
By using Eq. 18 and Eq. 19, Eq. 17 can be derived as 
	$$ H_i(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 2 e^{(-\pi B_i T)} cos(2 \pi F_i T) z^{-1} + e^{(-2 \pi B_i T)} z^{-2}}, \qquad (20) $$
	where \(F_s = \frac{1}{T}\) represents the sampling frequency.

</p>
<p>
For example, the magnitude response of an all-pole system \(H(z)\) with resonant frequency \(F_i\) = 1000 Hz,\(B_i\) = 100 Hz and \(F_s\)  = 8000 Hz
is shown in Figure 5. The impulse response is a samped sinusoidal signal. The damping depends on the bandwidth of the pole of the system.

Consider a train of impulse sequence, \(I(nT_0)\), with each impulse located at integer multiples of \(T_0\) (\(T_0 \gt\gt T\)) as shown in Figure 6. 
The output resonance of the system \(O(nT)\) is shown in Figure 7. The output signal is periodic with fundamental period (\(T_0\)) (from which the fundamental frequency is obtained as 
\(F_0 = \frac{1}{T_0}\)) is shown in Figure 7.

<h2>Part 1: Aliasing and quantization effect</h2>
<h3>1-A: Sampling and aliasing</h3> 
	    <ul>
<li><p>Select one of the sample .wav files provided and click on the load button.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Click on the play button. Listen carefully to the quality of the signal, in terms of perceived background noise/distortion and clarity or intelligibility of the sounds/message.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Change the sampling frequency to 8000 Hz and listen to the utterance. Perceive the change in quality of speech between 16 kHz and 8 kHz, by repeatedly switching between 16 kHz and 8 kHz.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Listen to the utterance at 4 kHz, 2 kHz, and 1 kHz. Observe the degradation in quality as the sampling rate is reduced.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Repeat the experiment with the anti-aliasing flag checked. Do you perceive any change in distortion between with and without anti-aliasing? Why?</p></li><br>
<li><p>Repeat the experiment for a recording of your own voice.</p></li><br>
</ul>
<h3>1-B: Quantization effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Select back the sampling frequency of 16 kHz. Anti-aliasing flag may be set to anything, as it is immaterial here.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Reduce the bits/sample value to 8 from 16. Listen and compare the utterances for the two different bits/sample values.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Reduce the bits/sample to 4, 2, and 1. Listen and compare the quality of speech as the bits/sample is reduced.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Note that the message is intelligible even at 1 bps though it is highly noisy.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Repeat the experiment for a recording of your own voice.</p></li><br>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Part 2: Design of resonator</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><p> The sampling frequency \(F_s\) is fixed to 8000 Hz.</p></li><br>
<li><p> Choose the resonant frequency \(F_1\) between the values (0 to 1000 Hz) and bandwidth of resonator \(B_1\)</p></li><br>
<li><p> Choose the value of \(F_0 (\frac{1}{T_0})\), which corresponds to the impulse train excitation.</p></li><br>
<li><p> Study the effect of the choice of resonant frequency \(F_1\), bandwidth \(B_1\) and fundamental frequency \(F_0\)</p></li><br>
</ul>
<!--
<h2>Part 2: Filter design</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Set the \(F_0\) value to 1 Hz, so as not to perceive the effect of pitch.</li><br>
<li>Now listen to the resonator output for different frequencies - 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, for a bandwidth (BW) of 0 Hz.</li><br>
<li>Now for a \(F_1\) value 100 Hz, study the effect of varying the BW from 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, and 1000 Hz. Repeat the experiment for \(F_1\) values of 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Observe the impulse response and magnitude response of the filter in each case.</li><br>
<li>Now set the pitch frequency \(F_0\) to 100 Hz, resonance frequency \(F_1\) to 2000 Hz. Listen tothe responses for bandwidths 0 Hz and 4000 Hz.
Notice that you perceive predominantly the effect of 2000 Hz tone at 0 Hz BW, and the effect of pitch frequency 100 Hz (train of impulses) at 4000 Hz BW.</li><br>
<li>Now fix the BW at 0 Hz, and \(F_1\) at 2000 Hz. Vary the pitch frequency \(F_0\) from 1, 10, 100, and 1000 Hz. Notice that the effect of resonance dominates at 0 Hz BW, irrespective of the pitch frequency chosen.</li><br>
<li>Repeat the experiment with \(F_0\) at 1000 Hz, BW at 4000 Hz, and by changing \(F_1\) values to 10, 100, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Notice that you perceive predominantly the effect of pitch frequency for a large BW (4000 Hz) irrespective of the resonance frequency.</li><br>
<li>Now fix the BW at 100 Hz or 50 Hz. study the effect of varying \(F_1\) for a fixed value of \(F_0\) say 100 Hz. Also study the effect of varying \(F_0\) for a fixed value of \(F_1\) sat 2000 Hz. Notice that you perceive both the effect of \(F_0\) and \(F_1\) to varying degrees for different combinations of \(F_0\), \(F_1\), and BW.</li><br>
